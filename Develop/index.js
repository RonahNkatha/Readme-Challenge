## Table of Contents (Optional)

${answers.table_of_content}

## Installation

${answers.installation}

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an "assets/images" folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

${answers.credits}
## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
